Build a Solidity and ether.js-powered DApp addressing token distribution challenges in Web3 organizations. Organizations can register, creating ERC20 tokens with adjustable vesting schedules for stakeholders (investors, founders, etc.). Whitelisted addresses access vested tokens after set periods. The user-friendly interface allows wallet connection, admin registration, stakeholder addition, and claiming. Develop Solidity contracts for registration, token creation, stakeholder management, and vesting. Design a frontend for wallet integration, admin actions, and user interaction. Thoroughly test on a testnet. Successful completion entails functional contracts, an intuitive frontend, and comprehensive test validation, streamlining token vesting in the Web3 landscape.
